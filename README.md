ðŸš§ Under Construction, not quite ready yet

**Basic steps until we have an MVP** 
- [x] Basic Library Structure
- [x] Implement Basic Image Processing Operations
- [x] Implement complete, basic Neural network
- [x] Add tests for Mean Squared Error of network output
- [x] Implement for Video
- [ ] Redo API for easier use
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Publish as a basic NPM Package
- [ ] Performance tests

** Other things I'd like to do with this project **
- [ ] Re-implement with compute shaders for better performance
- [ ] Provide notebook and scripts for writing and training custom networks
- [ ] Provide lower level control for developers
- [ ] Write a chrome plug-in optimizing to implement this easily
- [ ] Build a static website to upscale videos on your device for free
